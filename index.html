                <p>Ask AI was a 0-to-1 product launch. The project started as an idea to help users extract information from a document. We began by validating our users' needs through product surveys. Then put together a design prototype for concept testing for further value validation. We continued iterating on the design prototype through usability testing. Meanwhile, our team of engineers built a feasibility prototype used for employee dogfooding. This dogfooding exercise led us to iterate on the quality of responses before launch. Ask AI is currently in Beta launched to a limited set of users.</p>

                <p>Career Guide is a career content hub that provides jobseekers with advice on how to get hired.</p>

                <p>Career Guide was a 0.1-to-1 product launch. The project started as an idea to scale the amount of content we could upload to our CMS. At the time, the Career Guide team was using WordPress for building the site and managing its content. The team uploaded and edited articles one at a time. This process was manual and limited the amount of content the team could get live on the site. We migrated from WordPress to a Gatsby framework using Strapi as a headless CMS. We also redesigned the front-end so the site was easier to navigate and the scaled content easy to access. The result was 1000s of articles uploaded daily and more time for our editors to focus on editing.</p>
