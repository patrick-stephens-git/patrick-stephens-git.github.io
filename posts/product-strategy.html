                <h1>Product Strategy</h1>
                    <p>Define your product strategy by answering the following questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- What is your business trying to achieve?</li>
                        <li>- What are your target customers trying to achieve?</li>
                        <li>- What market offerings exist that your target customers use to achieve their goal?</li>
                        <li>- What value does your product provide?</li>
                        <li>- What value is your product missing?</li>
                        <li>- How can you take actions that exploit your advantage?</li>
                        <li>- Which actions should you take?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>What is your business trying to achieve?</h2>
                    <p>Your business goals are the metrics your business is trying to impact:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- increase purchases</li>
                            <li>- increase sign-ups</li>
                            <li>- increase retention</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>In some cases, this is a goal within a strategic pillar of your business:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- increase a core action</li>
                            <li>- increase applies to a job posting</li>
                            <li>- increase friend requests sent</li>
                            <li>- increase documents created</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h2>What are your target customers trying to achieve?</h2>
                    <p>Who are your target customers?</p>

                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>What are your target customers trying to do? This is sometimes referred to as their job to be done:</p>
                        <div class="example-content-container">
                            <ul>

                        </div>
                    <p>What are your target customers' common use cases? These are all possible routes that your users go down to achieve their job to be done:</p>

                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h2>What market offerings exist that your target customers use to achieve their goal?</h2>
                    <p>What market offerings do your target customers compare your product to?</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- If they are trying to achieve an online presence then they might compare a Squarespace website to a Facebook business page</li>
                            <li>- If they are trying to get from point A to point B then they might compare a bike to an Uber</li>

                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Why would your target customers leave the market offering they currently use? Your target customers will leave the market offering they use today if it's missing value.</p>
                    <h2>What value is your product missing?</h2>
                    <p>What problems do your target customers have that make achieving their goal hard when using your product?</p>
                    <h2>What value does your product provide?</h2>
                    <p>What solutions make it easy for your target customers to achieve their goal when using your product? What do your users love about how your product helps them achieve their goal?</p>
                    <h2>How can you take actions that exploit your advantage?</h2>
                    <p>What stage of Product Market Fit (PMF) are you in?</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- If pre-PMF then prioritize actions that exploit your counter-position</li>
                            <li>- If post-PMF then prioritize actions that exploit scale economies, network economies, switching costs</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Which actions should you take? (Roadmap)</h2>
                    <p>Based on your answers to the questions above, you should know:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- What your target business metrics are</li>
                            <li>- Who your target customers are and what their goal is</li>
                            <li>- Which market offerings your target customers use today and why they would be willing to switch to a new market offering</li>
                            <li>- Which problems your product has</li>
                            <li>- What value your product offers that your target customers love</li>
                            <li>- How to take actions that exploit your advantage</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Using the information you've learned, create and maintain a list of actions you can take:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Problems that, if solved, would add a value that your competitors don't provide. This pulls your target customers to your product from your competitors' products</li>
                            <li>- Problems that, if solved, would stop your target customers from switching to a competitor product (that has already solved the problem)</li>
                            <li>- Value to maintain that your target customers love because it makes it easy for them to achieve their goal</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Categorize the list by whether or not an item can exploit your advantage.</p>
                    <p>Rerank the list by which items would have the most impact on your business goals if worked on.</p>
