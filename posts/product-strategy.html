                    </div>
                    <p>What problems do your target customers have that make achieving their goal hard when using your product? How quickly can you get your target customer to complete the "aha" moment? Can you reduce the time it takes to receive value from your product?</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">

                            <li>- Reduce time to established value by removing friction in the user task flow leading up to the core action representing the “aha” moment (double down on your existing value); increase user retention</li>
                            <li>- Scale established value if justified by ROI; increase user acquisition and retention</li>

                    <p>Categorize the list of actions by whether or not an item can exploit an advantage.</p>
                    <p>Rerank the list by which items would have the most impact on your business goals if worked on.</p>
