                <h1>Assumption Validation</h1>
                <p>Engineering time is expensive. It should focus on creating valuable, usable, feasible, and viable solutions. You should have a hypothesis before you've dedicated engineers to solving a problem. Validate the assumptions you made about the hypothesis in order to gather evidence that increases the likelihood of your hypothesis being true.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Gathering Evidence</h2>
                <h3>Anecdotal Evidence</h3>
                <p>Anecdotal evidence gives you signals that there might be a way you can add value to a product. This type of evidence is helpful, but it's not the truth. You are making assumptions that need validation with this type of evidence. You will want clear evidence before dedicating engineering resources to build a solution.</p>
                <h4>Types of Anecdotal Evidence</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>- <b>Feedback:</b> What do your users tell you about your product? You can use resources like NPS, reviews, customer support tickets, online forums, rage actions, user interviews, surveys, or dogfooding.</li>
                    <li>- <b>Data Analysis:</b> How many daily active users experience the problem? Where do users drop off in the funnel?</li>
                    <li>- <b>Competitive Analysis:</b> Do your competitors solve this problem? Are you doubling down on a solution that your competitors don't offer? Use your competitors' products. Talk with your target customers that use your competitors' products.</li>
                    <li>- <b>Industry Research:</b> What's happening in the industry? You can use resources like <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/topic/search/" target="_target">NN/g</a> and many more.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Clear Evidence</h3>
                <p>Clear evidence gives you clear signals that you can add value to a product. The type of evidence represents the truth. It's okay to not have this evidence at the start. You may need to set up a research plan to gather this type of evidence. You might need support from a designer or an engineer to gather it. Clear evidence gives you confidence that solving the problem has a higher likelihood of impact.</p>
                <h4>Types of Clear Evidence</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>- <b>True Events:</b> Can you show me the problem? You can use resources like dogfooding, video recordings of user sessions, usability testing, or human judgements.</li>
                    <li>- <b>Value Validation:</b> Does solving this problem add value? You can learn more about validating value below.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Value Validation</h2>
                <p>Your product strategy should include a list of actions you can take that add value to your product. How confident are you in the value each action will add? How confident is your team? If you're interested in learning if an action you're taking is creating value then you can read about it in this <a href="https://patrickcstephens.com/posts/product-strategy.html" target="_self">product strategy</a> post.</p>
                <p>You as the product manager are the owner of validating value. You can start working with your design and engineer partners to validate value with prototypes as your confidence increases.</p>
                <p><b>No Prototype</b> - <i>does not require design and engineering effort</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>- <b>Fake Door Test:</b> A link that does not take the user to the solution, but instead takes the user to a landing page. Use this page to tell the user you are seeking customers to talk to about solving a problem. Use this to recruit customers if you are going to do an invite-only test. Additionally, the clicks on the link are a measurement of user interest.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Usability Prototype</b> - <i>requires only design effort</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>- <b>Value Test at the end of a Usability Test:</b> Does the solution solve the user problem? Does the user ask if they will be able to use the solution? Would the user take time to work on the solution with us, even if we don't need them to?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Hybrid Prototype</b> - <i>requires some design and / or engineering effort</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>- <b>Wizard of Oz Test:</b> Does the solution solve the user problem? Apply the frontend experience to a small set of a population. Use a human or a manually curated database to pull the strings behind the scenes. Use this test to collect success signals from a limited amount of users.</p></li>
                    <li><p>- <b>Side-by-Side Test:</b> Gather human judgements offline. Do your raters experience more value in the new offering or in the old offering? This test is useful for validating the value of solving a quality problem.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Live Data Prototype</b> - <i>requires the most design and engineering effort</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>- <b>A/B Test:</b> Apply the new experience to a percentage of users (99%/1%) or (50%/50%). Use this test to collect success signals from a limited number of users. The prototype you are testing with users is not production-ready code.</li>
                    <li>- <b>Invite-Only Test:</b> Use when you don't have enough traffic to do an A/B Test. Recruit users to use your prototype. Collect success signals from a limited number of users. The prototype you are testing is not production-ready code.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Usability Validation</h2>
                <p>When the user experiences the problem are they aware of the solution? Is the user aware of how to solve their problem using the solution? Does the user run into friction when attempting to complete the task? At this point you are working with your designer on a design prototype. Test this prototype with your users or target customers.</p>
                <p>Your design partner is the owner of validating usability.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Feasibility Validation</h2>
                <p>Can your business build the solution? How much effort would it take to build the solution? Validate feasibility as you and your engineering team walk-through the solution together.</p>
                <p>Your engineer partner is the owner of validating feasibility.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Viability Validation</h2>
                <p>Connect with your stakeholders and walk them through the problem and the solution. Let them bring up any viability concerns about your product. Validate those concerns. Stakeholder viability concerns might come from sales, finance, legal, security, marketing, or other teams that you work with.</p>
                <p>You as the product manager are the owner of validating viability.</p>
