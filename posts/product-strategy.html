                <h1>Product Strategy</h1>
                    <p>Define your product strategy by answering the following questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- What is your business trying to achieve?</li>
                        <li>- What are your target customers trying to achieve?</li>
                        <li>- What market offerings exist that your target customers use to achieve their goal?</li>
                        <li>- What value does your product provide?</li>
                        <li>- What value is your product missing?</li>
                        <li>- How can you take actions that exploit your advantage?</li>
                        <li>- Which actions should you take?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>What is your business trying to achieve?</h2>
                    <p>Your business goals are the metrics your business is trying to impact: increase purchases, sign-ups or retention. In some cases, this is a goal within a strategic pillar of your business: increase a core action (applying to a job posting, sending a friend request, or creating a document).</p>
                    <h2>What are your target customers trying to achieve?</h2>
                    <p>Who are your target customers? For example, a jobseeker (gig-work, entry-level, mid-career, professional).</p>
                    <p>What are your target customers trying to do? This is sometimes referred to as their job to be done: get hired in a remote position.</p>
                    <p>What are your target customers' common use cases? These are all possible routes that your users go down to achieve their job to be done: searching for a job posting using job title queries, company name queries, or skill based queries.</p>
                    <h2>What market offerings exist that your target customers use to achieve their goal?</h2>
                    <p>What market offerings do your target customers compare your product to? If your target customers are trying to achieve an online presence then they might compare a Squarespace website to a Facebook business page. If they're trying to get from point A to point B then they might compare a bike to an Uber. If they're trying to increase their energy then they might compare a cup of coffee to a Snickers bar.</p>
                    <p>Why would your target customers leave the market offering they currently use? Your target customers will leave the market offering they use today if it's missing value.</p>
                    <h2>What value is your product missing?</h2>
                    <p>What problems do your target customers have that make achieving their goal hard when using your product?</p>
                    <h2>What value does your product provide?</h2>
                    <p>What solutions make it easy for your target customers to achieve their goal when using your product? What do your users love about how your product helps them achieve their goal?</p>
                    <h2>How can you take actions that exploit your advantage?</h2>
                    <p>What stage of Product Market Fit (PMF) are you in?</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>- If pre-PMF then prioritize actions that exploit your counter-position.</li>
                    <li>- If post-PMF then prioritize actions that exploit scale economies, network economies, switching costs.</li>
                    </ul>                    
                    <h2>Which actions should you take? (Roadmap)</h2>
                    <p>Based on your answers to the questions above, you should know: your business metrics, who your target customers are and what their goal is, which market offerings your target customers use today and why they would be willing to switch to a new market offering, which problems your product has, what value your product offers that your target customers love, and how to take actions that exploit your advantage.</p>
                    <p>Using the information you've learned, create and maintain a list of actions you can take:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Problems that if solved would add a value that your competitors don't provide. This pulls your target customers to your product from your competitors' products.</li>
                        <li>- Problems that if solved would stop your target customers from switching to a competitor product (that has already solved the problem).</li>
                        <li>- Value to maintain that your target customers love because it makes it easy for them to achieve their goal.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Categorize the list by whether or not an item can exploit your advantage.</p>
                    <p>Rerank the list by which items would have the most impact on your business goals if worked on.</p>
                    <p>Start ideation and have fun with your team!</p>
