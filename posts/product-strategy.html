                    <p>Define your product strategy by answering the following questions:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- What is your business trying to achieve?</li>
                            <li>- What are your target customers trying to achieve?</li>
                            <li>- What market offerings exist that your target customers use to achieve their goal?</li>
                            <li>- Can your target customer achieve their goal using your product?</li>
                            <li>- What value does your product provide?</li>
                            <li>- How can you take actions that exploit your advantage?</li>

                    </div>
                    <h2>What is your business trying to achieve?</h2>
                    <p>Your business goals are the metrics your business is trying to impact:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Increase sign-ups</li>

                    </div>
                    <h2>What are your target customers trying to achieve?</h2>
                    <p>Who are your target customers? Who are the users that would be very disappointed if they could no longer use your product? These are the customers that consider your product a must-have. Your target customers will be important for identifying how you should position your product.</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>

                    </div>
                    <p>What are your target customers trying to do? This is sometimes referred to as their job to be done:</p>

                            <ul>

                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    <p>What are your target customers' common use cases? How would your target customers use your product to achieve their goal? These are all possible routes that your users go down to achieve their job to be done:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Looking to get hired as a specific job title</li>
                            <li>- Looking to get hired at a specific company</li>

                    <p>Measure a core action that represents your target customers achieving their goal (the “aha” moment). Increasing this core action should correlate to increasing your business metrics.</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- When a job posting is applied to</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h2>What market offerings exist that your target customers use to achieve their goal?</h2>
                    <p>What marketing offerings do your users compare your product to when trying to achieve their goal?</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Online job boards</li>

                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Why would your target customers leave the market offering they currently use? Your target customers might leave the market offering they use today if another offering provides more value.</p>
                    <p>Why would your target customers leave your product for a different market offering? Your target customers might leave your product if another offering provides more value.</p>
                    <h2>Can your target customer achieve their goal using your product?</h2>
                    <p>What value is your product missing? What are your target customers' use cases that your product doesn't solve for? This is common when exploring new problem spaces.</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Needing to research a company</li>
                            <li>- Needing to research salaries</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h2>What value does your product provide?</h2>
                    <p>How does your product make it easy for your target customers to achieve their goal? What do your users love about your product? What is the primary benefit that your target customers receive when using your product?</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>What problems do your target customers have that make achieving their goal hard when using your product? How quickly can you get your target customer to complete the "aha" moment? Can you reduce the time it takes to receive value from your product?</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Reduce friction in the user task flow leading up to an apply</li>

                    <h2>Do you have an advantage? How can you take actions that exploit it?</h2>
                    <p>What stage of Product Market Fit (PMF) are you in?</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- If pre-PMF then prioritize actions that exploit your counter-position</li>
                            <li>- If post-PMF then prioritize actions that exploit scale economies, network economies, switching costs</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Which actions should you take next?</h2>
                    <p>Maintain a list of actions that you can take to help your target customers achieve their goal and to help your business achieve its goal. Actions are not roadmap items. Actions represent initiatives. Multiple roadmap items can fall under a single initiative. Your actions will likely fall within one of the categories below:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Add new value by building a way for your target customers to achieve their goal using your product; increase user acquisition</li>
                            <li>- Reduce time to established value by removing friction in the user task flow leading up to the core action representing the “aha” moment (double down on your existing value); increase user retention</li>
                            <li>- Scale established value if justified by ROI; increase user acquisition and retention</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Categorize the list by whether or not an action can exploit an advantage. Rerank the list by which actions are estimated to have the most impact on your business goals if worked on. Now that you have a list of prioritized actions to work on next it's time to start the <a href="/posts/product-development-lifecycle.html">product development lifecycle</a>.</p>
