                <h1>Product Strategy</h1>
                <p>Who are your users and what does it take to win them?</p>
                <p>Developing a product strategy is essential for aligning your product's direction with your business goals while meeting user needs and standing out in the market. It's also one of the most enjoyable parts of the job - you get to play detective! Your strategy should be clear, actionable, and adaptable to changes, ensuring your product remains relevant and competitive.</p>
                <p>Below is a framework you can use for defining a product strategy.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>The Detective Work:</h2>
                <h3>1. Do you know your business strategy?</h3>
                <p>Before diving into product specifics, it's crucial to understand your broader business strategy and company vision. A strong business strategy provides a foundation for your product strategy, ensuring that your product development efforts are aligned with your company's goals. For instance, if your business aims to increase customer retention, your product strategy should focus on addressing the factors that influence customer retention and satisfaction.</p>
                <h3>2. Can you describe your users?</h3>
                <p>You <i>need</i> to know who your users are. Understanding their needs, behaviors, and challenges. This user insight is the cornerstone of developing a product that truly resonates with your target audience.</p>
                <h4>What are your users trying to do?</h4>
                <p>First understand what your users are trying to do. This could involve tasks like finding specific information, completing a purchase, or communicating with others. Knowing your users' objectives allows you to build features and functionalities that directly address these needs.</p>
                <h3>3. What market is your business playing in?</h3>
                <p>Pinpointing the market in which your product operates is essential for positioning and differentiation. Understand the competitive landscape, market trends, and the needs of your target audience. By knowing the market, you can better tailor your product to meet the demands of your users while standing out from competitors.</p>
                <h4>Who do your users compare you to?</h4>
                <p>Users will compare your product to existing solutions in the market. Understand who your competitors are and how users perceive them to help you identify your product's strengths and weaknesses. This comparison can reveal opportunities for differentiation and innovation, allowing you to position your product more effectively.</p>
                <h3>4. What value does your product provide?</h3>
                <p>The value your product provides is the primary reason users choose it over alternatives. Understand why users pay for your product and what keeps them coming back.</p>
                <p>Be able to answer these questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>- why do your existing users pay?</li>
                <h3>5. What stops your users from doing what they're trying to do?</h3>
                <p>Understand what prevent your users from achieving their goals with your product. These problems could range from usability issues to lack of certain features.</p>
                <h4>Where in the funnel do your users drop-off?</h4>
                <p>Be able to answer these questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>- why do your existing users stop paying?</li>
                    <li>- what stops potential users from paying?</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Solving the Mystery:</h2>
                <p>By now, you should be able to tell me about:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>- <b>business goals:</b> what are you trying to achieve?</li>
                    <li>- <b>target user:</b> what are they trying to achieve?</li>
                    <li>- <b>market:</b> what do they offer that their users love? what do their users wish they offered?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Using the evidence you've gathered you should be able to provide multiple answers to the following questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>- <b>existing value:</b> why do your users choose your product and not the competitors' products?</li>
                    <li>- <b>missing value:</b> why do your users choose your competitors' products and not your product?</li>
                    <li>- <b>unsolved problems:</b> why can't your existing users achieve what they're trying to achieve with your product? why can't your competitors' users achieve what they're trying to achieve with your competitors' products?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>6. Where should you focus your effort?</h3>
                <p>You can't solve every problem at once, so your next step is to prioritize where to focus your effort. This involves listing out your answers to the questions above and prioritizing them by which will have the biggest impact on your business goals. Prioritizing your efforts ensures that your team's resources are directed towards the projects that will drive the most value.</p>
                <h4>Adding new value, doubling down on existing value, or both?</h4>
                <p>Solving problems that prevent your users from achieving their goals could involve fixing bugs, streamlining processes, or adding new features. On the other hand, reinforcing the value your product already provides could involve optimizing popular features, improving system performance, or expanding on your product's core capabilities, which can help strengthen your competitive advantage.</p>
                <h3>7. Now you have a roadmap</h3>
                <p>Once you've identified where to focus, you can create a product roadmap that outlines the steps needed to achieve your goals. This roadmap should include specific actions, timelines, and milestones that guide your team from strategy to execution. A well-defined roadmap ensures that everyone is aligned and working towards the same objectives, providing a clear path from idea to market.</p>
