                <h1>Search from a Product Perspective</h1>
                <p>What is the problem you're trying to solve? The core of search is helping your users find <i>something</i>. What does your business offer your users? How do your users search for it? Who are your users? Understanding links between documents, queries, and users is key to solving search problems.</p>
                <h2>What can you learn from your documents?</h2>
                <p></p>
                <p>Spend time understanding the documents that represent what your business offers your users. If the documents are job postings then they might contain the job title, company name, or job description. You can use this information to surface relevant documents to your users.</p>
                <p>You can classify your documents to match user needs:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Job category: engineering, marketing</li>
                        <li>- Job industry: finance, healthcare</li>
                        <li>- Job type: full-time, part-time, contract, intern</li>
                        <li>- Experience level: entry-level, mid-level, senior-level</li>
                        <li>- Location type: on-site, remote, hybrid</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>You can annotate your documents to match user needs:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Skills: python, java, agile methodologies</li>
                        <li>- Size: small business, medium-sized company, large enterprise</li>
                        <li>- Salary range: low, medium, high</li>
                        <li>- Benefits: health insurance, 401k match, relocation assistance</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Document understanding has different use cases depending on the document type, query type, and user type. Make your documents searchable by knowing what information they provide and how your users are searching for them.</p>
                <h2>What can you learn from your users' queries?</h2>
                <p>Know how your users are searching and what information your document contains to surface relevant documents. If your users are searching for jobs then their queries may contain job titles, company names, or skills. You can use this information to surface relevant documents to your users.</p>
                <p>You can classify your queries to match user needs:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- The query "remote software engineer" can be classified as "location type: remote; job category: engineering"</li>
                        <li>- The query "healthcare marketing" can be classified as "job industry: healthcare; job category: marketing"</li>
                        <li>- The query "entry-level finance" can be classified as "experience level: entry-level; job industry: finance"</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>You can annotate your queries to match user needs:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- The query "product manager google" can be annotated as "product manager: job title; google: company name"</li>
                        <li>- The query "python developer" can be annotated as "python: skill; developer: job title"</li>
                        <li>- The query "$100,000 salary" can be annotated as "$100,000: high salary range"</li>
                        <li>- The query "no experience jobs" can be annotated as "entry-level: experience level"</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>You can rewrite your queries to match user needs:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- The query "product management" can be rewritten as "product manager"</li>
                        <li>- The query "swe" can be rewritten as "software engineer"</li>
                        <li>- The query "twitter" can be rewritten as "x"</li>
                        <li>- The query "20 hour per week jobs" can be rewritten as "part-time jobs"</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Query understanding has different use cases depending on the query type, document type, and user type. Make your documents searchable by knowing how your users are searching for them and what information they provide.</p>
                <h2>What can you learn from your users?</h2>
                <p>Understand your users. If your users are searching for job postings then they might provide their location, employment history, or salary expectations. You can use this information to surface relevant documents to your users.</p>
                <p>You can classify your users to match their needs:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- If your user is located in Austin, TX then you can retrieve documents where "location: austin, tx"</li>
                        <li>- If your user has no work history then you can retrieve documents where "experience level: entry-level"</li>
                        <li>- If your users has python skills then you can retrieve documents where "skills: python"</li>
                        <li>- If your users has employment history working in small businesses then you can retrieve documents where "size: small business"</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>User understanding has different use cases depending on the user type, document type, and query type. Make your documents searchable by knowing your users and what information they provide.</p>
                <h2>How do you retrieve relevant results?</h2>
                <p>Using the information you've learned above you can build a query to match against documents. If you know that your user has python skills and searches for "remote swe" then the query to retrieve documents could be:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <pre>
                        <code>
{
    "query": {
        "bool": {
        "must": [
            {
            "multi_match": {
                "query": "software engineer",
                "fields": ["job_title^3", "job_description"]
            }
            },
            {
            "term": {
                "location_type": "remote"
            }
            },
            {
            "term": {
                "skills": "python"
            }
            }
        ],
        "should": [
            {
            "match": {

    ]
    }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>This query represents the user intent. Using this query you'll retrieve a list of documents ordered by relevance.</p>
                <h2>How do you rank the results by relevance?</h2>
                <p>Using the list of documents you've retrieved you can rerank them so the most relevant documents are at the top. If your user searches for "product manager jobs in austin tx" they may want to find a popular job that other users have already applied to. We can rank the documents with a ranking model that predicts a relevance score using features from our documents, the user's query, and the relation between them.</p>
                <p>Solve search problems by first understanding your documents, queries, and users. Then optimize your search results with retrieval and ranking.</p>
