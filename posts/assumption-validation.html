                <h1>Assumption Validation</h1>
                <p>Resources are expensive. They should focus on creating valuable, usable, feasible, and viable solutions. You should have a hypothesis before you've dedicated resources to solving a problem. Validate the assumptions you made about the hypothesis in order to gather evidence that increases the likelihood of your hypothesis being true.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Gathering Evidence</h2>
                <p>Gather evidence to increase confidence in if you are adding value or reducing time to value.</p>
                <h3>Anecdotal Evidence</h3>
                <p>Anecdotal evidence gives you signals that you can add new value to your product or reduce time to value. This type of evidence is helpful, but it's not the truth. You are making assumptions that need validation. You will want clear evidence before dedicating resources to build a solution.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>Feedback:</b> What do your users tell you about your product? Some methods for learning this include NPS, reviews, customer support tickets, online forums, user interviews, surveys, or dogfooding.</li>
                        <li>- <b>Data Analysis:</b> Where do users drop off in the funnel? How many daily active users experience the problem?</li>
                        <li>- <b>Competitive Analysis:</b> Do your competitors solve this problem?</li>
                        <li>- <b>Industry Research:</b> What's happening in the industry? You can use resources like <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/topic/search/" target="_target">NN/g</a> and many more.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Clear Evidence</h3>
                <p>Clear evidence gives you clear signals that you can add new value to your product or reduce time to value. The type of evidence represents the truth. It's okay to not have this evidence at the start. You may need to set up a research plan to gather this type of evidence. You might need support from a designer or an engineer to gather it. Clear evidence gives you confidence that solving the problem has a higher likelihood of impact.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>True Events:</b> Can you show me the problem? Some methods for learning this include dogfooding, video recordings of user sessions, or usability testing.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Value Validation</h2>
                <p>Your product strategy should include a list of actions you plan to take next. How confident are you in the value each action will add? How confident is your team? If you're interested in learning about how to decide which actions to take then you can read about it in this <a href="https://patrickcstephens.com/posts/product-strategy.html" target="_self">product strategy</a> post.</p>
                <p>You as the product manager are the owner of validating value. You can start working with your design and engineer partners to validate value with prototypes as your confidence increases.</p>
                <h3>No Prototype - does not require design and engineering effort</h3>
                <p>Gather anecdotal evidence showing if your target customers have interest in your solution.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>Fake Door Test:</b> A link that does not take the user to the solution, but instead takes the user to a landing page. Use this page to recruit customers to interview about solving this problem. You can use this to recruit customers if you are going to do an invite-only test. Use click data as a measurement of user interest.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Design Prototype - requires only design effort</h3>
                <p>Gather anecdotal evidence about how your target customers perceive your solution. Gather clear evidence by learning if your solution adds new value or reduces time to existing value.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>Value Test at the end of a Usability Test:</b> Does the solution solve the user problem? Does the user ask if they will be able to use the solution? Would the user commit time to partner with us on testing the solution?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Engineering Prototype - requires only engineering effort</h3>
                <p>Gather anecdotal evidence about how your target customers perceive your solution.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>Side-by-Side Test:</b> Gather human judgements offline. Do your raters experience more value in the new offering or in the old offering?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Hybrid Prototype - requires some design and / or engineering effort</h3>
                <p>Gather anecdotal evidence showing if your target customers have interest in your solution. Gather clear evidence by learning if your solution adds new value or reduces time to existing value.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>Wizard of Oz Test:</b> Does the solution solve the user problem? Apply the frontend experience to a small set of a population. Use a human or a manually curated database to pull the strings behind the scenes. Use this test to collect success signals from a limited amount of users.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Live Data Prototype - requires the most design and engineering effort</h3>
                <p>Gather clear evidence by learning if your solution adds new value or reduces time to existing value.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>A/B Test:</b> Apply the new experience to a percentage of users (99%/1%) or (50%/50%). Use this test to collect success signals from a limited number of users. The prototype you are testing with users is not production-ready code.</li>
                        <li>- <b>Invite-Only Test:</b> Use when you don't have enough traffic to do an A/B Test. Recruit users to use your prototype. Collect success signals from a limited number of users. The prototype you are testing is not production-ready code.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Usability Validation</h2>
                <p>When the user experiences the problem are they aware of the solution? Is the user aware of how to solve their problem using the solution? Does the user run into friction when attempting to complete the task? At this point you are working with your designer on a design prototype. Test this prototype with your users or target customers.</p>
                <p>Your design partner is the owner of validating usability.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Feasibility Validation</h2>
                <p>Can your business build the solution? How much effort would it take to build the solution? Validate feasibility as you and your engineering team walk-through the solution together.</p>
                <p>Your engineer partner is the owner of validating feasibility.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Viability Validation</h2>
                <p>Connect with your stakeholders and walk them through the problem and the solution. Let them bring up any viability concerns about your product. Validate those concerns. Stakeholder viability concerns might come from sales, finance, legal, security, marketing, or other teams that you work with.</p>
                <p>You as the product manager are the owner of validating viability.</p>
